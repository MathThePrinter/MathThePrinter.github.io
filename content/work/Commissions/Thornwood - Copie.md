##  The beer bottles of Brasserie Artisanale Autre Monde
These illustrations were made as a commission for a french Brewery. You can see the creatures on display on their beer bottles on their website as well

### The creative process

This commissioned work has taken place in 2022, and as one of my **personal projects**, it took me way more than necessary because i wanted it to be perfect. From the choice of the paper, to the illustration itself. This was more than just an illustration project: it was **a product development**, and i have to say : i nailed it.

The images on display are just mock ups, but i can assure you the beer bottles are very real, and the beer is good.
