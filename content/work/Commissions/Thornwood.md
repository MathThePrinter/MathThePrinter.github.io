## Thornwood Parfums

This project was a commission from a NZ brand in the **fragrance** game. They wanted to develop a strong **artwork line**, invoking the **heavy designs** from the **gothic medieval era**, that i love and try to put forward. 

Thornwood wanted 5 woodcuts that evoked a specific mind state. Just as if you could describe an **olfactive impression with words.** Difficult, innit? Well i did exactly that with **feelings** and **linocut.**
