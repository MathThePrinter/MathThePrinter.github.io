### The Goblin landsknecht

This is an original artwork freely inspired by the XVI century woodcuts. The graphic style tends to imitate the master woodcutters **(DÃ¼rer, Egenolff, Wolgemut)** of the late XVth century, early XVIth , both in terms of tools, techniques, and the posture and symbolism itself. 

The scene represents a Goblin Landsknecht wearing a XVIth century costume, as seen on imagery *(woodcuts, paintings, drawings)*, from that period of time. Though there is little information regarding goblin folk at this era, the costume field itself is pretty well documented. This print is a part of a tryptich concerning 3 warriors : a dwarf, a goblin and a human, all three wearing XVIth century war gear.

**When you do not know what to draw, draw a goblin**

## The techniques 

The **sketch** was directly drawn on the lino block, then **inked with a quill** on the block. Once dried out, the block was **carved with gouges**: the linocut process itself. 


To print out something, the carved block was **inked with a brayer and printing ink** and the sheet of paper was **pressed** using a printing linocut press.
