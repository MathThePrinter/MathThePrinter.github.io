### The Landsknecht

This is an original artwork freely inspired by the XVI century woodcuts. The graphic style tends to imitate the master woodcutters **(DÃ¼rer, Egenolff, Wolgemut)** of the late XVth century, early XVIth , both in terms of tools, techniques, and the posture and symbolism itself. 

The scene represents a Landsknecht wearing a XVIth century costume, as seen on imagery *(woodcuts, paintings, drawings)*, from that period of time. This print is a part of a tryptich concerning 3 warriors : a dwarf, a goblin and a human, all three wearing XVIth century war gear.

**This linocut was deeply inspired by renaissance art, because being a a history nerd is a good way to be inspired by cool stuff**

## The techniques 

The **sketch** was directly drawn on the lino block, then **inked with a quill** on the block. Once dried out, the block was **carved with gouges**: the linocut process itself. 


To print out something, the carved block was **inked with a brayer and printing ink** and the sheet of paper was **pressed** using a printing linocut press.
