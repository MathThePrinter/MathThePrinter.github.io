## Stormtrooper on Tattooine

This is an original artwork freely inspired by the XVI century woodcuts. The graphic style tends to imitate the master woodcutters **(DÃ¼rer, Egenolff, Wolgemut)** of the late XVth century, early XVIth , both in terms of tools, techniques, and the posture and symbolism itself. 

The scene represents a Stormtrooper of the Galactic Empire, burning down the huts of poor farmers.

**This linocut was deeply inspired by Star Wars, because being a nerd is a good way to be inspired by cool stuff**

## The techniques 

The **sketch** was directly drawn on the lino block, then **inked with a quill** on the block. Once dried out, the block was **carved with gouges**: the linocut process itself. 


To print out something, the carved block was **inked with a brayer and printing ink** and the sheet of paper was **pressed** using a printing linocut press.

**Golden ink** was added to the final print, to highlight some details on the final print, such as for the **weapon**, some part of the **armor**, and the trooper's eyes.
