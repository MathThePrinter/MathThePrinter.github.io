### The Dwarwen Brewery

This fantastic representation of a dwarven colony-sized booze frenzy was inspired by a XIIIth treatise on beer brewing [[available here]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjb5ZeT3bb9AhWug_0HHenwAIAQFnoECA8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbibliotekanauki.pl%2Farticles%2F699914.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1sWkAEvvD5ZbzspOrWOXcN) This linocut depicts a **dwarven brewery**, a personal view of this poem. 

Mainly because I like dwarves and i think the fantasy kind of dwarf encapsulates perfectly the light spirit that i thought might correspond to this XIIIth brewery. This contains the original verses in old french, describing all the **malting** and **brewing** process, to the final step of **getting hammered** and wanting to forget about it all.

## The techniques 

The **sketch** was originally drawn on transparent paper, then reported on the lino block, then **inked with** on the block. Once dried out, the block was **carved with gouges**: the linocut process itself. This process was particularly long, due to the massive amount of texts that is included in the orginal poem. 

*This was one of my earliest projects, one of my biggest occasions to learn and do mistakes. My skill level when i started was nothing close to the one i had when i finished it.*

To print out something, the carved block was **inked with a brayer and printing ink** and the sheet of paper was **pressed** using a printing linocut press.
