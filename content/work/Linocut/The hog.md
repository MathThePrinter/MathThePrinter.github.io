### The Hog

This is an original artwork freely inspired by modern linocuts. Stepping aside from my usual renaissance inspired artworks, i decided to take a shot at a modern design.

The scene represents a **wounded hog**, pierced by several arrows. The main thing about this linocut was to nail the **fur**, and the shading of the hairs.

## The techniques 

The **sketch** was directly drawn on the lino block, then **inked with a quill** on the block. Once dried out, the block was **carved with gouges**: the linocut process itself. 


To print out something, the carved block was **inked with a brayer and printing ink** and the sheet of paper was **pressed** using a printing linocut press.
