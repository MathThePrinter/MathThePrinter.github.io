### Brother Saint Georges in a Dreadnought, fighting with Big Boss Drakka da Dragon

2021, not colorised. 

I always loved greenskins and history. And when i had the chance to create an artwork that could use both my passions, i jumped on it.

This project was the right occasion to try to tighten the bonds between a medieval motif and a modern approach of it. I wanted to go for the **religious effect** on the render, as were the woodcuts from the **gothic medieval era**, at the very first years of XVIth century

## The techniques 

The **sketch** was originally drawn on transparent paper, then reported on the lino block, then **inked with** on the block. Once dried out, the block was **carved with gouges**: the linocut process itself. This process was particularly long, due to the massive amount of texts that is included in the orginal poem. 

*This was one of my earliest projects, one of my biggest occasions to learn and do mistakes. My skill level when i started was nothing close to the one i had when i closed it.*

To print out something, the carved block was **inked with a brayer and printing ink** and the sheet of paper was **pressed** using a printing linocut press.
