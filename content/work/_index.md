Math The Printer is an art name in use since 2019.
Now located in Burgundy ( ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ), i am specialized in  **illustration, graphic design** and **artisanal printmaking**.

My art finds its inspirations in medieval art, woodcuts, science fiction and fantasy novels. 

During the first years of my practice i specialized in linocut prints, deeply inspired by medieval gothic art. As of today, my work tends to include a wider range of techniques now such as digital art, pen and ink drawing
