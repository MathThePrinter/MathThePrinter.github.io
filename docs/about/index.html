					<h3 id="personal-art-manifesto">Personal Art Manifesto</h3>
<p>From my perspective, I see woodcut taking its roots in two artistic movements: the first being <strong>international gothic art</strong>, and the second <strong>renaissance art</strong>, which intrinsincly conveys the <strong>humanistic values</strong> of that period of time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more than interesting to notice that graphic conventions were directly dictated by the medium employed (wood for the blocks) as other were dictated by graphic and societal conventions.
As of today, the technical means that i dispose of allow me to pass through all of it and <strong>overcome both cultural and technical obstacles.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, the process of looking back and analyzing how graphic cultures of eastern europe did represent the things five centuries before is primitively motivated by the <strong>will to discover a way to depict the world that is no longer of use</strong>. The technological urge to learn, and any form of need being entirely absent, I believe,leaves the artistic desire lead the way and explore the path.</p>
<h4 id="my-desire-is-to-explore-and-reappropriate-a-culture-of-printmaking-in-which-the-inspirations-are-as-medieval-as-the-process-is-modern-in-its-retrospective-and-analytical-aspects">My desire is to explore and reappropriate a culture of printmaking, in which the inspirations are as medieval as the process is modern, in its retrospective and analytical aspects.</h4>
<p>My way to practice that art is in itself at the crossroads of several artistic motivations:</p>
<p><strong>The wish to practice and recreate a way to depict</strong> bodies, symbols and objects that no longer exists today. In XVIth century, the woodcuts of <strong>Michael Wolgemut</strong>, or later, <strong>Albrecht DÃ¼rer</strong> were state of the art means to put the world into image. Five centuries of progress made in the art field leaves the past artists as a form of archeological singularities, let for the eye to explore at will.
The wish to practice that form of long forgotten art is not as strongly a primitivist approach, as it is a way to take back and <strong>make alive again</strong> an art practice that is no longer of use.</p>
<h4 id="the-aim-behind-that-is-to-offer-an-alternative-culture-of-the-image-as-a-first-form-of-divergence-cultivate-a-graphic-art-process-that-steps-out-of-the-actual-graphic-and-societal-conventions">The aim behind that is to offer an alternative culture of the image, as a first form of divergence: cultivate a graphic art process that steps out of the actual graphic and societal conventions.</h4>
<p>In practice, the artistic render evokes the medieval and modern period, in its symbolism, the postures, the graphic conventions around bodies and character traits, but also in the alea intrinsincly linked to the techniques and medium employed (cutting a wooden block, fiber paper printing)</p>
<p>The second wish is the one of the expression itself: as an artist i wish to use the medium as the <strong>manifestation of my own creativity</strong>, and take as mine the techniques I learn from studying the master engravers of the past. The pride taken in creating an artwork that resembles the ones i studied for years, and seeing fewer and fewer differences with the time, is a form of joy that tethers me to my interest in that particular form of art.
The expression here has a meaning both in terms of <em>technÃ¨</em> and <em>poiesis</em>. (Those terms are to be taken cautiously, and with Aristotle nearby to ensure the use i made of it is valid.)</p>
<p><strong>TechnÃ¨</strong> stands for the use of techniques and the pleasure to witness with enough time a form of mastering of the artistic process (drawing, mastering the quills and gouges)
and the
<strong>Poiesis</strong>, which allows mental representation to take form in effect, in a graphic representation. The practice itself, of that form of art.
This second dimension is of capital importance in my conception of the art process, because it excludes the act of copy, or facsimile. Even though i understand copying is a great way to get started and maybe allow better results than the longer path to come up with orginal designs, i prefer the latter. This comes along with an internalization of works of art and other inspiring contents, and a load of internal work to &ldquo;process&rdquo; that and allow pieces of art to become trully a source of inspiration. Then, the restitution takes part in the process, in which the human is perfect in its imperfection and the <em>mens</em> will omit and alter certain parts even without noticing. At this moment, during this act of imperfection, the partial art that was somehow rendered can be called an original work of art. And this form of <strong>emergence is for me in truth, the expression itself.</strong></p>
