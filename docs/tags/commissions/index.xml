      <description>The Chimera (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· La ChimÃ¨re) This illustration was made as a commission for a french Brewery. You can see the creatures on display on their beer bottles on their website http://brasserieautremonde.fr/ The brewery only displays the illustrations in black and white, and the colored version are more a proof of concept of coloring my own digital art.
Technique The technique used was, as i like to call it &amp;ldquo;Digital carving &amp;quot; technique.</description>

      <description>Thornwood Parfums This project was a commission from a NZ brand in the fragrance game. They wanted to develop a strong artwork line, invoking the heavy designs from the gothic medieval era, that i love and try to put forward.
Thornwood wanted 5 woodcuts that evoked a specific mind state. Just as if you could describe an olfactive impression with words. Difficult, innit? Well i did exactly that with feelings and linocut.</description>

      <title>Game Of Thrones Fan art &#39;#1</title>

      <description>The technique The sketch was originally drawn on transparent paper, then reported on the lino block, then inked with on the block. Once dried out, the block was carved with gouges: the linocut process itself. This process was particularly long, due to the massive amount of texts that is included in the orginal poem.
This was one of my earliest projects, one of my biggest occasions to learn and do mistakes.</description>
