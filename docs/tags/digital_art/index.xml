      <description>Sweet Zombie Jesus This illustration was done under an hour in Krita
This was made out of fun, between 2 and 3 AM instead of going to bed. Every late night drawing begins with &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rsquo;mon, just one last bit&amp;rdquo;. And ends up way to late.
Technique The technique used was, as i like to call it &amp;ldquo;Digital carving &amp;quot; technique. This consists in several succssive steps
Sketching using a pencil brush Put a black layer on top, in high opacity to distinguish the sketch through the canvas With a white brush, or on erasing mode, withdraw the black from the canvas to create the whites.</description>

      <description>The Chimera (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· La ChimÃ¨re) This illustration was made as a commission for a french Brewery. You can see the creatures on display on their beer bottles on their website http://brasserieautremonde.fr/ The brewery only displays the illustrations in black and white, and the colored version are more a proof of concept of coloring my own digital art.
